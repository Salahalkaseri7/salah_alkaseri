Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Poly Technic Computer branch and got introduced to programming in my Third Sem of year And At [MGM college Nanded](https://www.mgmccsit.ac.in/). Since then, I started developing Android Apps And Web Development and pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering.

Today, I'm currently working on Self Projects and Android Devlopment using Flutter(Dart) and also Android Studio.
