- The actual idea to develop this project come from the communication accuracy or time saving, just to save time of people throught this specticular thought... i decided to make a project that when a user selects an accurate chellenge time duration, the entered message of a person will be measured or analyzed through the software, and added a tris game in which words will fall in a container at specified speed, and you have to type that words before the drop in container if failed then game over! and a history section where you can check the previous typing test result by date and time. â€œTo complete your work faster it is important to develop typing skills, typing help you to work comfortably on the computer or in other devices,it aids in communicating with colleagues and customers, creating document, and finding new information".Used lang. Html,css and js combine.
