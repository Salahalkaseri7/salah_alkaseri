I'm an India based developer with a goal-driven creative mindset and passion for learning and innovating.

Currently I am a Student of Computer science And Technology At [MGM College](https://www.mgmccsit.ac.in/) and a self taught learner at [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/profile/20463074).

Outside work, I occasionally make 2D Games on [Unity](https://unity.com/) or create Android Apps using FLutter/Android Studio [TypingSpeedo](https://salahalkaseri7.github.io/Typing-speedo/). Off-screen, I Read Books like [mastery](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_(book)>)!
